# Tanmatsu project for testing new demoscene stuff (faster graphics etc)

It is based on the [Template app](https://github.com/Nicolai-Electronics/tanmatsu-template) and the [Ballz demo](https://github.com/cavac/tanmatsu-ballz)

This isn't a demo itself, but will test stuff to make better, cooler demos ;-)
